I setup this blog as an extension of my personal website: https://www.jackcworkman.com. I wanted a space where I could create a portfolio without the additional overhead of website management and html/css design. I soon stumbled upon Hugo, a static site generation tool, and with it I was able to put this site together in minutes. Posts are written in markdown, themes are plentiful, and deploying is done in a handful of commands thanks to the no-hassle hosting of GitHub Pages.
